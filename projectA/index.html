                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Chromatiaceae is a family of photosynthetic bacteria known for their ability to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, meaning they do not produce oxygen as a byproduct of their photosynthetic process. Instead, they utilize various sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or elemental sulfur as electron donors in photosynthesis.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Members of the Chromatiaceae family are typically found in environments rich in organic matter, such as sediments of freshwater lakes, ponds, or sulfur-rich environments like hot springs and sulfide-rich muds. They often form characteristic sulfur granules within their cells, which aid in the storage of sulfur compounds for use in photosynthesis.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The appearance of the Chromatium Ogeni is similar to the Chromatium Okenii -- round in shape and colorful. Because of the Chromatium Ogeni's extreme sensitivy to touch, it is prone to pigment redistribution when touched. Additionally, the bacteria will speed up in movement when exposed to natual or artificial light.</p>

This remarkable organism possesses an extraordinary ability to randomly change its color when touched, which has fascinated observers and sparked curiosity about its underlying mechanisms.Found primarily in regions abundant in sunlight, Chromatium Ogeni showcases remarkable agility and swiftness in its movements. It thrives in environments where

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with the Chromatium Ogeni : </span> The Chromatium Ogeni has two main reactions. First, when exposed to light or sunlight (turn on the light by pressing the Space Key), the Ogeni moves faster than it would in darkness. Secondly, when poked (poke by pressing on a circle with the mouse), it will trigger the pigment redistribution and cause the Chromatium Ogeni to change color.
